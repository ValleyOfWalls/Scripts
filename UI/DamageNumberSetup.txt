Damage Number System Setup Guide (No Prefabs)
=========================================

Follow these steps to set up the damage number popup system:

1. Setup EffectsCanvas:
   - In the scene hierarchy, locate the "EffectsCanvas" GameObject
   - Make sure the Canvas has:
     - Render Mode: Screen Space - Camera
     - Render Camera: Main Camera
     - Sort Order: Above all other UI canvases (higher than your other UI canvases)
   - Add the DamageNumberManager script to the EffectsCanvas

2. Configure DamageNumberManager in Inspector:
   - Text Styling:
     - Default Font Size: 36 (for regular damage and healing)
     - Critical Font Size: 42 (for critical hits)
     - Font Asset: Assign your preferred TextMeshPro font (optional, will use default if empty)
     - Damage Color: Red (#FF0000)
     - Critical Color: Orange (#FF8000)
     - Heal Color: Green (#00FF00)
   - Animation Settings:
     - Display Duration: 1.5 seconds
     - Popup Delay Between Numbers: 0.1 seconds
     - Initial/Pop/Final Scale: Adjust to control the "pop" effect
     - Move Distance: How far the numbers float upward
     - Fade Out Duration: How long it takes to fade out at the end

3. Update Project:
   - Make sure you have DOTween in your project (used for animations)
   - If not, import it from the Asset Store or add via package manager

4. Testing:
   - Run the game and test combat
   - When damage or healing occurs, you should see animated numbers appear
   - Critical hits will show larger orange numbers with exclamation points
   - Healing will show green numbers with + prefixes

No prefabs are needed - the system creates all UI elements dynamically at runtime!

The damage popup will display different styles based on:
- Regular damage: Red numbers
- Critical damage: Orange, larger numbers with exclamation mark
- Healing: Green numbers with + prefix
